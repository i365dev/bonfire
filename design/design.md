# Design of this project

## Why is this project started?

I was looking for a place to record all the books I like. It is expected to have such features:

* Having a list of books I've read and am reading.
* Able to track the progress of my current reading.  Improve my reading habit by recording and reviewing
* With my personal view at books, like comments.
* Able to share and communicate over books. Allow others to share their books.
* Suggesting which books to read
* Tell me when a book which I may be interested in is published.

I can't find any websites or tools focusing on the progress of reading, so I decide to make it myself.

## What makes this project outstanding?

1. **Easy to track.** Cross-platform, lightweight, rich features of interacting with the physical world, ISBN barcode scanning for instance.
2. **Profiling.** It should provide a good profile of me, revealing what kind of knowledge I have acquired.
3. **Inspirating** by following others readers, authors, forums
2. **Watch new book publishing**
